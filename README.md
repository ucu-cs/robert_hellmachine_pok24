# robert_hellmachine_pok24
The POÐš-2024 initiative is a student project where the team is working on building an autonomous vehicle called the Hell Machine. It's part of the Principle of Organization Computer's course at Ukrainian Catholic University, with support from mentors Oleg Farenyuk and Andriy Ozgovych. The goal is to create a self-driving robot that can follow set routes or take commands, using technologies like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and LIDAR.

This project builds on what previous student groups have done, aiming to improve the system's functionality and reliability. In the end, we hope to develop a smart robotic platform that could be useful for things like autonomous navigation, teaching robotics, or even helping in risky or hard-to-reach areas.
